Description: ML language implementation with a class-based object system
 Objective Caml (OCaml) is an implementation of the ML language, based on
 the Caml Light dialect extended with a complete class-based object system
 and a powerful module system in the style of Standard ML.
 .
 OCaml comprises two compilers. One generates bytecode
 which is then interpreted by a C program. This compiler runs quickly,
 generates compact code with moderate memory requirements, and is
 portable to essentially any 32 or 64 bit Unix platform. Performance of
 generated programs is quite good for a bytecoded implementation:
 almost twice as fast as Caml Light 0.7. This compiler can be used
 either as a standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces
 standalone programs, or as an interactive, toplevel-based system.
 .
 The other compiler generates high-performance native code for a number
 of processors. Compilation takes longer and generates bigger code, but
 the generated programs deliver excellent performance, while retaining
 the moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler. It is not
 available on all arches though.
 .
 This package contains everything needed to develop OCaml applications
 that do not require the graphics library.

Description: Pre Processor Pretty Printer for OCaml
 Objective Caml (OCaml) is an implementation of the ML language,
 based on the Caml Light dialect extended with a complete
 class-based object system and a powerful module system in the
 style of Standard ML.
 .
 CamlP4 is a Pre-Processor-Pretty-Printer for Objective Caml. It
 offers tools for syntax (Stream Parsers and Grammars) and the
 ability to modify the concrete syntax of the language
 (Quotations, Syntax Extensions).
 .
 This package contains the basic CamlP4 executables and libraries
 for pre-processing and pretty-printing OCaml sources both
 interactively and in a batch fashion.

 .
 This package contains pre-linked executables and libraries for
 pre-processing and pretty-printing OCaml sources out of the box
 for various common needs.

Description: Runtime system for OCaml bytecode executables
 Objective Caml (OCaml) is an implementation of the ML language, based on
 the Caml Light dialect extended with a complete class-based object system
 and a powerful module system in the style of Standard ML.
 .
 This package contains only the runtime system needed to run bytecode
 executables that do not use the graphics library. The 'ocaml' package
 contains the full development suite of Objective Caml.

Description: Native code compilers of the OCaml suite (the .opt ones)
 Objective Caml (OCaml) is an implementation of the ML language, based on
 the Caml Light dialect extended with a complete class-based object system
 and a powerful module system in the style of Standard ML.
 .
 This package contains the native code version of the compilers and lexer
 (ocamlc.opt, ocamllex.opt, ocamlopt.opt, camlp4o.opt and camlp4r.opt).
 The normal version of these programs are found in the 'ocaml' package.
 For big source codes, these packages can be two to three times faster, but
 for most normal sized sources, the difference won't be noticeable.
