ocaml (3.09.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Samuel Mimram ]
  * Cleaning ocaml-md5sums, closes: #346279.

  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * build-arch is a phony target.
  * Add patch to make ocamlopt -output-obj and ocamlopt -pack call the linker
    via gcc instead of directly, which allows us to pass the same linking
    options in these cases and in the common case (where ocamlopt already used
    gcc). This should unbreak ocamlopt -pack on alpha, and thus fix the build
    failure of camomile.

  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * New upstream release
    + sparc is correctly detected and alignment of doubles and 64-bit ints on
      double-word boundaries is forced (Closes: #344615).
  * Remove Suggests on xlibs-dev which doesn't exist anymore.

ocaml (3.09.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * debian/rules: the abi-sed rule is phony, we don't want to run configure
    twice.
  * Stop building the native compilers on hppa, they are buggy and upstream
    considers this port dead (see bug#342704).

  [ Samuel Mimram ]
  * Added for_pack_static.dpatch (from CVS) to correct a bug when linking,
    disabled for now though.
  * Added myself to uploaders.

  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * Install the list of architectures with native compilers in the ocaml-nox
    package.

  [ Sven Luther ]
  * This version should make it into testing, so let's (Closes: #338435).

    debian/rules in the previous release. Sorry for this :(

 -- Julien Cristau <julien.cristau@ens-lyon.org>  Fri,  9 Dec 2005 11:01:06 +0100

ocaml (3.09.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified debian/rules to exit with an error when native compiler build
    fails, instead of building a broken package.
  * New patch kbsd-gnu.dpatch to add support for GNU/Hurd and GNU/k*BSD on
    i386 (thanks to Robert Millan and Aurélien Jarno; Closes: #216886).
  * Add myself to Uploaders (acked by Sven).
  * Add patch by Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org> to fix native code linking
    by passing the --no-relax option to ld (Closes: #338437).
    Bug#335578 stays open since a proper fix to the generated asm would still
    be better than this workaround.

  * Updated to new upstream release.
  * Modified the packaging ifrastructure to not use hard-coded abi number
    except in the head of debian/rules. All else is sed'ed from #OcamlABI#
    (and #OcamlMAJOR# for the debian/copyright file and the upstream url).

ocaml (3.08.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream stable point version.
    - breaks binary compatibility, we thus have to up the ABI version
      to 3.08.3.
  * New features
    - ignore unknown warning options for forward and backward compatibility
    - runtime: export caml_compare_unordered (PR#3479)
    - camlp4: install argl.* files (PR#3439)
    - ocamldoc: add -man-section option (Closes: #287538)
    - labltk: add the "solid" relief option (PR#3343)
    - compiler: ocamlc -i now prints variance annotations
  * Bug fixes:
    - typing: fix unsoundness in type declaration variance inference.
      Type parameters which are constrained must now have an explicit variant
      annotation, otherwise they are invariant. This is not backward
      compatible, so this might break code which either uses subtyping or
      uses the relaxed value restriction (i.e. was not typable before 3.07)
    - typing: erroneous partial match warning for polymorphic variants (PR#3424)
    - runtime: handle the case of an empty command line (PR#3409, PR#3444)
    - stdlib: make Sys.executable_name an absolute path in native code (PR#3303)
    - runtime: fix memory leak in finalise.c
    - runtime: auto-trigger compaction even if gc is called manually (PR#3392)
    - stdlib: fix segfault in Obj.dup on zero-sized values (PR#3406)
    - camlp4: correct parsing of the $ identifier (PR#3310, PR#3469)
    - autoconf: better checking of SSE2 instructions (PR#3329, PR#3330)
    - graphics: make close_graph close the X display as well as the window (PR#3312)
    - num: fix big_int_of_string (empty string) (PR#3483)
    - num: fix big bug on 64-bit architecture (PR#3299)
    - str: better documentation of string_match and string_partial_match (PR#3395)
    - unix: fix file descriptor leak in Unix.accept (PR#3423)
    - unix: miscellaneous clean-ups
    - unix: fix documentation of Unix.tm (PR#3341)
    - compiler: fix error message with -pack when .cmi is missing (PR#3028)
    - cygwin: fix problem with compilation of camlheader (PR#3485)
    - stdlib: Filename.basename doesn't return an empty string any more (PR#3451)
    - stdlib: better documentation of Open_excl flag (PR#3450)
    - ocamlcp: accept -thread option (PR#3511)
    - ocamldep: handle spaces in file names (PR#3370)
    - compiler: remove spurious warning in pattern-matching on variants (PR#3424)

    Garbee for trying to solve this issue, but since the release approaches,

ocaml (3.06-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the /usr/include/caml issue. (Closes: #173720)

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Dec 2002 10:31:55 +0100

ocaml (3.06-14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the (bad) /usr/lib/ocaml/3.06/ld.conf that comes with the ocaml
    package.
  * Now run ocaml-ldconf in ocaml postinst also. This is needed since
    /usr/lib/ocaml/3.06/ld.conf was in ocaml 3.06-13 and will thus be removed
    when we upgradeto 3.06-14.
  * Some script cleanup.

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Dec 2002 00:05:22 +0100

ocaml (3.06-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ocaml and ocaml-base now provides ocaml-3.06-1 and ocaml-base-3.06-1. All
    library packages depending on ocaml-3.06 and ocaml-base-3.06 are now
    uninstallable, and should be rebuilt with these new dependencies. Notice
    that a bug in dpkg (Bug#170825) allows to upgrade ocaml to 3.06-13 even if
    packages depending on the older virtual provides are still present,
    apt-get handles this properly.
  * Changed libdir from /usr/lib/ocaml to /usr/lib/ocaml/3.06, and adapted the
    ocaml_packaging_policy consequently.
  * Added Stefano's section on META files and findlib in the
    ocaml_packaging_policy.
  * Now /usr/include/caml is a symlink to /usr/lib/ocaml/3.06/caml, and not
    the other side around. Need to find a nicer solution here, or even stop
    shipping the headers in /usr/include. One solution would be to ship them
    under /usr/include/ocaml/3.06/caml.

ocaml (3.06-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied posix systhread patch from Xavier. Now the tick thread dies
    properly when killing a threaded native code program. (Closes: #144719)

  * Applied Stefano's .ocamlinit patch. (Closes: #166199)
  * Added a debconf template to fill /etc/magic with the appropriate ocaml
    magic.

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Sun, 27 Oct 2002 00:20:24 +0200

ocaml (3.06-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ocaml needed a rebuild, since native code compilation using the Str
    library was broken. I don't really understand what did break, most
    probably it is one of the developpment libraries (binutils, libc6, ...)
    which did change in an incompatible way we are not aware of.
  * Now ship objinfo. (Closes: #165446)
  * Applied odoc_man.ml patch from Maxence i got out of CVS. (Closes: #159581)
  * Removed /usr/lib/ocaml/ld.conf from the ocaml package, since it is shipped
    with ocaml-base. (Closes: #161742)

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Wed, 23 Oct 2002 10:20:04 +0200

ocaml (3.06-6.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * (NMU) recompile at maintener request
    Since i uploaded ocam lsource only, ocaml-source was not built,
    so i asked for an NMU, not having the bandwith for uploading ocaml-source
    myself. (Sven Luther)

 -- Remi Vanicat <vanicat@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Sep 2002 11:46:27 +0200

ocaml (3.06-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * ocaml-ldconf in postrm was called only on remove, not upgrade.
    (Closes: #159859).
  * Moved ocaml-source stuff to /usr/src.
    (Closes: #159862).
  * Added more verbose info to ocaml-ldconf.ml
    (Closes: #159860).
  * Now ocaml-ldconf also accepts the -R option to remove all directories
    associated with the given package.

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Fri,  6 Sep 2002 18:12:18 +0200

ocaml (3.06-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Removed reference to /usr/include/ocaml in README.Debian.
    (Closes: #158126).

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Mon,  2 Sep 2002 14:38:22 +0200

ocaml (3.06-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Apparently the dh_ocamlld patch did not do, i will now call ocaml-ldconf
    in ocaml-base.postinst, to be sure the /usr/lib/ocaml/ld.conf is created
    correctly (Closes: #158905).

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Mon,  2 Sep 2002 14:04:17 +0200

ocaml (3.06-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Added a Provide: ocaml-source-3.06 to the ocaml-source control file.

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Fri, 30 Aug 2002 09:39:25 +0200

ocaml (3.06-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Now we create the /usr/local/lib/ocaml directory in the postinst instead
    of including it in the package. We also don't fail if we are not able to
    create this directory (if /usr/local is mounted read-only for example).
    (Closes: #157898)
  * Now use mmap() instead of malloc() for allocation of major heap chunks,
    for alpha (same fix as for the ia64 problem encountered previously).
    (Closes: #158444)

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Thu, 29 Aug 2002 08:26:53 +0200

ocaml (3.06-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream (bugfix) release. (Closes: Bug#139427)
  * 3.05 as released by upstream was broken, i should not have uploaded it (as
    it broke all the libraries) but it was too late when i was made aware of
    the problems with 3.05.
  * Added a statement in the ocaml-source package description that it is _not_
    supposed to be used for building ocaml. (Closes: #150077)
  * Now ship labltk examples and README file. (Closes: #152588)
  * Added ia64 to the list of arches who support the native code compilers.
    (Closes: #157110)
  * Removed .opt man pages from the list of files of the ocaml package.
    (Closes: #152237)
  * Camlp4 -where now gives the correct path. (Closes: #155701)
  * Now include a default /usr/lib/ocaml/ld.conf file in the ocaml-base
    package. (Closes: #156042, #155428)
  * Updated ocaml_packaging_policy and README.Debian file.
  * ocaml-ldconf now handles directory only lines in /etc/ocaml/ld.donf as the
    add command.
  
 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Aug 2002 15:36:45 +0200

ocaml (3.05-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
  * Now /usr/lib/ocaml/stublibs is the default path for storing dynamic stub
    libraries. We still keep the ocaml-ldconf/dh_ocamlld stuff on, as it may
    still be usefull and for backward compatibility, but we will slowly
    migrate all library packages to use the new path.
  * Some updates to the policy file (standard stublib path, findlib, ...)
  * Now ship labltk examples and README file.
  * This upstream release fixes the bytecode compilers for powerpc (the same
    as the patch applied in 3.04-9) and ia64.

ocaml (3.04-12) unstable; urgency=high

    packages. (Closes: Bug#138642)

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Wed, 24 Apr 2002 11:25:17 +0200

ocaml (3.04-11) unstable; urgency=high

  * Now install also the emacs caml-help.el file.

    upstream's CVS (hope it works) (Closes: Bug#134113)
  * Fixed ocaml-ldconf so it would work even if the files did not exist, and
    added two of the ld.conf files as conffiles (not /usr/lib/ocaml/ld.conf,
    which is a install time generated package).
  * Renamed the include files again to /usr/include/caml, as it breaks things
    otherwise.

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Mon, 18 Feb 2002 11:30:35 +0100
