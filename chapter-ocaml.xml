    At any given time, the package <application>ocaml</application>
    should represent the current stable upstream version of &ocaml-name; 
    revision &ocaml-version;.

    This package provides a virtual package called &ocaml-pkg;. 
    This will help to track incompatible changes made within the

    <title>File terminology for Ocaml packaging</title>

    <para>
     &ocaml-name; is a complete language allowing to create :
     <simplelist>
      <listitem>bytecoded executable</listitem>
      <listitem>bytecoded library ( *.cma )</listitem>
      <listitem>native executable</listitem>
      <listitem>native library ( *.cmxa )</listitem>
      <listitem>shared library ( for C-binding ) ( dll*.so )</listitem>
      <listitem>static library ( for C-binding ) ( lib*.a )</listitem>
      <listitem>bytecoded object ( *.cmo )</listitem>
      <listitem>native object ( *.cmx )</listitem>
      <listitem>configuration file for handling library ( META )</listitem>
      <listitem>ocamldoc generated documentation ( *.odoc )</listitem>
     </simplelist>
    </para>
   
    <para>
     There is a convention considering that native executable should be 
     called <application>progname</application>.opt and bytecoded one 
     <application>progname</application>.byte. When packaging, only 
     <application>progname</application> is taken in account.
    </para>

    <para>
     For easying library management, the Ocaml Task Force used the 
     <application>ocamlfind</application> library management scheme.
     This scheme includes a file named <filename>META</filename> which holds
     all the library possibility. This is the configuration file for
     handling library ( see XXX ).
    </para>
   </section>
   
   <section id="path">
    <title>Library paths</title>
    <para>
    Ocaml will search library in two different location, referred to
    as <varname>local</varname> which hold user installed library and as 
    <varname>core</varname> in which packaged modules stood.
    </para>

    <para>
    By default, &ocaml-name; will look for modules in this order :
    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term><varname>local</varname></term>
      <para><filename>/usr/local/lib/ocaml/&ocaml-version;/</filename></para>
     </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term><varname>core</varname></term>
      <para><filename>/usr/lib/ocaml/&ocaml-version;/</filename></para>
     </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    </para>
   </section>

    <section id="documentation">
    <title>Documentation</title>
    <para>
    The documentation is a joint effort of  &ocaml-force; and usptream. 
    There is many way to have documentation : *.mli file, which is installed in 
    <filename>/usr/lib/ocaml/&ocaml-version;/</filename> and his subdirectory.
    You can also browse documentation with <application>ocamlbrowser</application>.
    At last, for some package, a special scheme is used to handle documentation 
    file : ocamldoc generated documentation. By this mean you can have different access
    to library documentation : using <application>docbrowser</application> which is
    shipped with <application>cameleon</application>, HTML pages registered under
    the <application>doc-base</application> <organization>Debian</organization> package,
    or manpages.
    </para>

    <para>As of this date, there is no automatic way to generate manpages and HTML 
    documentation with a debian package. For now, <filename>*.odoc</filename> files
    will be stored in <filename>/usr/share/ocamldoc-base</filename>. A tools, to
    auto-generate manpages and HTML documentation is under construction.
