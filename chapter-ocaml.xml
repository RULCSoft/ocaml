    At any given time, the package &ocaml-pkg; should represent

    This package provides a virtual package called &ocaml-vpkg;. 
    This will help to track incompatible changes made within the

     &ocaml-name; is a complete language allowing to create :
     <simplelist>
      <listitem>bytecoded executable</listitem>
      <listitem>bytecoded library ( <filename>*.cma</filename> )</listitem>
      <listitem>native executable</listitem>
      <listitem>native library ( <filename>*.cmxa</filename> )</listitem>
      <listitem>shared library ( for C-binding ) ( <filename>dll*.so</filename> )</listitem>

      <listitem>&ocamldoc; generated documentation ( <filename>*.odoc</filename> )</listitem>
     </simplelist>
    </para>
   
    <para>
     There is a convention considering that native executable should be 
     called <application>progname.opt</application> and bytecoded one 
     <application>progname.byte</application>. When packaging, only 
     <application>progname</application> is taken in account.
    </para>

    <para>
     For easying library management, &ocaml-force; used the 
     &ocamlfind; library management scheme. This scheme includes 
     a file named <filename>META</filename> which holds
     all the library possibility. This is the configuration file for
     handling library path and compile option.
    </para>

   <section id="documentation">
    <title>Documentation</title>
    <para>
    The documentation is a joint effort of  &ocaml-force; and usptream. 
    There is many way to have documentation : 
    <simplelist>
     <listitem>Header files ( <filename>*.mli</filename> )</listitem>
     <listitem>Source files ( <filename>*.ml</filename> )</listitem>
     <listitem>Specific documentation provided by the upstream</listitem>
     <listitem>OCamldoc generated documentation</listitem>
    </simplelist>
    </para>

    <para>
    This documentation should be browse by different mean, from the
    most simple to the most complex. At least, they could all be browsed with 
    simple text editor. Specific and &ocamldoc; generated documentation should 
    be browse by using different viewer ( like <application>advi</application>, 
    HTML browser ...). There is also at least two
    specific &ocaml-name; browser : <application>docbrowse</application> shipped
    with <application>cameleon</application> and <application>ocamlbrowser</application>
    shipped with &ocaml-name; itself. The first one, need specific
    &ocamldoc; generated documentation. The second one enables
    the user to browse directly the prototype of each function shipped in the cmi gives
    to the application.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    You can generate &ocamldoc; specific documentation by using
    the <option>-dump</option> of this application. By using this, you dump the 
    intermediary representation of the document that will be generated by ocamldoc.
    This can be used to generate HTML documentation and manpages, by reloading this
    file ( using <option>-load</load> ).
    </para>

    <para>
    As of today, there is no way to post-process &ocamldoc;
    specific documentation. A &debian-name; package is under construction to do this
    task. It will be referred as &ocamldoc-base;.
    </para>

   </section>  

   <section id="path">
    <title>Path for all &ocaml-name; component</para>

    <para>
    Ocaml will search library in two different location, referred to
    as <varname>local</varname> which hold user installed library and as 
    <varname>core</varname> in which packaged modules stood.
    </para>
 
    <subsection id="library-path">
    <title>Library paths</title>

     <para>
     By default, &ocaml-name; will look for modules in this order :
     <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
       <term><varname>local</varname></term>
       <listitem><filename>/usr/local/lib/ocaml/&ocaml-version;/</filename></listitem>
      </varlistentry>

     </variablelist>
     </para>

     <para>
     When installing a library, packagers should use a subdirectory of the preceding
     set of path. Subdirectory name is not mandatory. 
     <para>
     
     <para>
     If upstream developpers use already a subdirectory of the &ocaml-name; 
     standard library path, this path should be preserved in the &debian-name; 
     package, but made relative to the standard library path of the &ocaml-pkg;.
     Before using the provided subdirectory, packagers should check if there is 
     no subdirectory name clash with other &ocaml-name; library.
     </para>

     <para>
     If upstream developpers don't use this scheme, packagers are encouraged not
     to install this library in the standard library directory. They should create
     at least a subdirectory per source package ( in order to avoid library 
     name clash ). Packagers should also consider to do a larger separation by
     creating a subdirectory per binary package ( in order to avoid META name
     clash ).
     </para>

     <para>
     A suggested rule to choose name for this subdirectory is to use either the package 
     name provided by the META of the upstream, or the name of the library itself.
     </para>
     
    </subsection>

    <para>
    Even if this way of producing documentation is not mandatory, packagers are
    encouraged to use it, in order to ship lighter documentation, which could
    be processed by &ocaml-name; tools.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    By default, &ocamldoc-base; will look for <filename>*.odoc</filename> in this order :
